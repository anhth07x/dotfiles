# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
env:
  # TERM env customization.
  #
  # If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.
  #
  # Note that some xterm terminfo databases don't declare support for italics.
  # You can verify this by checking for the presence of `smso` and `sitm` in
  # `infocmp xterm-256color`.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels. If both are zero this
  # setting is ignored.
  dimensions:
    columns: 80
    lines: 35

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is not scaled by
  # DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  dynamic_padding: false

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Available values:
  # - full: borders and title bar
  # - none: neither borders nor title bar
  # - transparent: title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  # - buttonless: title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons
  decorations: full

  # Startup Mode (changes require restart)
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode`:
  #   - Windowed
  #   - Maximized
  #   - Fullscreen
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode` (macOS only):
  #   - SimpleFullscreen
  startup_mode: Windowed

scrolling:
  # maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer. Specifying '0' will
  # disable scrolling.
  history: 1000

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  multiplier: 3

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
font:
  # The normal (roman) font face to use.
  # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
  normal:
    family: Hack Nerd Font
    # family: "Fira Code"
    # family: "Source Code Pro"
    # style: Retina

  # The bold font face
  bold:
    family: Hack Nerd Font
    # family: "Fira Code"
    # family: "Source Code Pro"

  # The italic font face
  italic:
    family: Hack Nerd Font
    # family: "Fira Code"
    # family: "Source Code Pro"
    # style: "Medium Italic"

  # Point size of the font
  size: 9

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. offset.y can be thought of
  # as modifying the linespacing, and offset.x as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increase the x offset to move the glyph to
  # the right, increase the y offset to move the glyph upward.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina you
  # probably want this set to false.
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
  use_thin_strokes: true

# When true, bold text is drawn using the bright variant of colors.
draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: false

# Use custom cursor colors. If true, display the cursor in the cursor.foreground
# and cursor.background colors, otherwise invert the colors of the cursor.
